# Awe

Awe is a powerful, fast and simple entity component system based on Artemis. In
an entity component system, every thing in the world is represented by an int,
which is called an entity id. You can then attach data to these entities and run
system on entities with a selection of components.

## What can I do to speed up my project?

Nothing. Thanks to the power of Haxe macros, all of the optimisations that can be
done are done in the background.
